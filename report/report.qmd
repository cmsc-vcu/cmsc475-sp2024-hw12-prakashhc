Homework 12 serves up three different command line interface programs.  We're using python and the click library to create
beautiful user interfaces.  You get to decide what your program does.

# Reflection

* Should this module be taught at the beginning or the end of the semester?  That is, would these
skills have helped you with capstone had you know them earlier? I think that this assignment was appropriate in its current place. It allows me to finish mobile development during a time when I wasn't very stressed out, and allowed for an easy transition towards the end of the semester. I am not taking not currently taking capstone, so I cannot answer.
* How much time did you spend on this specific assignment? I spent about three hours on this assignment. 
* What was the easiest part of this specific assignment? The easiest part of the assignment was getting the API keys and finding the sources for currency exchange rates and weather. 
* What is the hardest part of this specific assignment? The hardest part of the assignment was writing the python code for associating the APIs with the variables.
